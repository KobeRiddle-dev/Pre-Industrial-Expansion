# Pre-Industrial-Expansion
A Rimworld mod expanding the pre-industrial game in a way that plays nice with the larger modding scene.

## Goals

1. **Expand the pre-industrial game so that playing tribal and medieval starts feels as robust as the playing an industrial start.**
2. **Play nice with other mods and enhance the experience of playing with them, instead of competing with them**
	- Avoid overlap
	- Add patches when needed
3. **Add processes for each tech tier so that production and crafting has a sensible progression**
	- Wait, doesn't a certain popular mod add this alongside a bunch of medieval stuff?
		- Yes, but that mod adds a whole lot of stuff and is kind of all-or-nothing. I like that mod a lot. I originally wanted to help make that mod more modular, but the author of that mod doesn't want it to be split into parts. That's within their rights as the owner of their intellectual property, and thus I began work on this project. :)
4. **Where possible, avoid things being made purely redundant and obsolete by later tech.** 
	- Sure, a laser sword will be better than a basic sword and an electric smithy is preferable to a basic workshop, but the more advanced versions rely on having the infrastructure and production chains established in order to make the materials and/or fuels needed, whereas the basic versions are readily available and cheap. Still obsolete and redundant, but not *purely* obsolete and redundant.

## Expanding the pre-industrial game

 To support our goals, we need to seriously expand the research needed between Basic Furniture and Electricity. It's just way too fast, and leaves tribal and medieval runs feeling stale.

- A rework of research projects and their prerequisites for a natural progression through technology
- New production chains so that there's more to do in the early tech tiers
	- Production chains are also extended into the industrial era and beyond! 
- New furniture for early tech tiers with differences in comfort, beauty, effectiveness, capability, etc.
	- Purely aesthetic differences are left to ideology styles or variants

### How do we decide which things belong in which tech tier?
Rimworld has 7 tech tiers: Animal, Neolithic, Medieval, Industrial, Spacer, Ultra, Archotech. Here's a generally accepted consensus on how we can use these:

- Animal: Pre-agriculture,
- Neolithic: Neolithic (stone age), bronze age, classical era
- Medieval: Medieval, Renaissance, age of sail/empires
- Industrial: As defined in real life, but condensed
- Spacer: Can do substantial space travel (Rimworld lore says 21st century humanity is between Industrial and Spacer)
- Ultra: The Shattered Empire, glitterworld tech
- Archotech: runaway AIs turned godlike entities

Largely, the Pre-Industrial Expansion focuses on the Neolithic and Medieval tech tiers, with production chains extending further, and some work done in the Industrial tier to enhance the transition into the industrial age.

## Processes

### Wood Working

- Wood Logs must be cut into lumber for most uses. 
- 1 log -> 2 lumber
- Special structures and furniture built with logs are less beautiful and comfortable, but are sturdier with higher HP.

Production stations:
- Neolithic:
	- Crafting spot: slow, 1 at a time cutting
	- Wood Trestle: with the assistance of proper tools, wood can be cut faster and in small batches
- Medieval:
	- Mechanical Lumber Mill: mechanical power allows for wood to be cut much faster and in bigger batches
- Industrial:
	- Electric Trestle: a fast version of the Wood Trestle, consuming power
	- Electric Lumber Mill: a faster version of the Mechanical Lumber mill, consuming electrical power instead of mechanical power

### Leather Tanning

- Raw hides must be hung and dried to create leather
- Should raw hides be unusable, or just worse than leather?
- Goal: less onerous and wood-consuming than Medieval Overhaul

Production stations:
- Tanning Rack
- Better medieval version?
- Industrial version

### Cloth Spinning/Weaving

Raw cloth resources -> fabric

Production stations:
- Neolithic:
	- Loom
- Medieval:
	- Mechanical loom
- Industrial:
	- Electric loom

### Stonecutting

Largely the same as vanilla, but with a slower stonecutting station for early tribals? Maybe, maybe not?

Production Stations:
- Neolithic:
	- Stonecutting block?
	- Vanilla stonecutting bench
- Medieval:
	- Mechanical stone mill? Is that even a thing?
- Industrial:
	- Electric stonecutting bench (requires water with Dubs Bad Hygiene)

### Metal Refining

- Neolithic:
	- Soft Metals: Bronze refining
		- From copper and tin ore?
	- Iron refining
	- Basic/Primitive Smelter, 40-50% speed
- Medieval:
	- Steel refining
		- Do we need coal or will charcoal do the trick? Maybe both is best
	- Crucible or something, Advanced Smelter, 65% speed
- Industrial:
	- Industrial fueled smelter (vanilla)
	- Electric smelter (vanilla)
### Component production

- Basic mechanical components for mechanical power

### Hay/Straw

- Hay is harvestable from grass and such
- Hay must be dried to create straw
### Food Chains

- Grain Milling
	- Manual, mechanical, and electric grain mills to turn grains into flours
- Pickling
	- Basic and industrial(?) pickling processes to create preserved foods
- Ice Cutting
	- Cutting ice and storing it in insulated areas for food preservation

## Additional furniture

Neolithic:
- Log furniture
	- Patches for ideo styles to make certain styles apply to log tables, chairs, etc. instead of normal tables, chairs, etc.

Medieval:
- Messenger bird comms station
