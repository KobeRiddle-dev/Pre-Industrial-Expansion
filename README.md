# Pre-Industrial-Expansion
A Rimworld mod expanding the pre-industrial game in a way that plays nice with the larger modding scene.

## Goals

1. **Expand the pre-industrial game so that playing tribal and medieval starts feels as robust as the playing an industrial start.**
2. **Play nice with other mods and enhance the experience of playing with them, instead of competing with them**
	- Avoid overlap
	- Add patches when needed
3. **Add processes for each tech tier so that production and crafting has a sensible progression**
	- Wait doesn't a certain mod add this alongside a bunch of medieval stuff? -- Yes, but that mod doesn't allow for modularity, doesn't play nice with other mods, and changes a lot in Rimworld, almost like a total conversion. It's nearly all or nothing. I like that mod a lot, and respect what they have done. In fact, this mod and its companion mods exist because I went to the team of that mod and offered to help them create modular versions of its various components in order to help that mod fit into non-medieval playthroughs. This isn't something they're interested in at all.
4. **Where possible, avoid things being made purely redundant and obsolete by later tech.** 
	- Sure, a laser sword will be better than a basic sword and an electric smithy is preferable to a basic workshop, but the more advanced versions rely on having the infrastructure and production chains established in order to make the materials and/or fuels needed, whereas the basic versions are readily available and cheap. Still obsolete and redundant, but not *purely* obsolete and redundant.

## Expanding the pre-industrial game

 To support our goals, we need to seriously expand the research needed between Basic Furniture and Electricity. It's just way too fast, and leaves tribal and medieval runs feeling stale.

- A rework of research projects and their prerequisites for a natural progression through technology
- New production chains so that there's more to do in the early tech tiers
	- Production chains are also extended into the industrial era and beyond! 
- New furniture for early tech tiers with differences in comfort, beauty, effectiveness, capability, etc.
	- Purely aesthetic differences are left to ideology styles or variants
